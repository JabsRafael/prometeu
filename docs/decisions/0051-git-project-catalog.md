# ADR 0051 — Git projects in portable catalogs

Date: 2026-09-19
Status: Accepted

## Context

People repeat Git clones and project registration on each Mac. The account and
organization catalogs already distribute portable definitions with revisions.

## Decision

Add `projects` to the existing catalog document and browser tabs. Each definition
contains a stable name, remote Git source and optional description. Reuse catalog
authorization, revision checks, local cache and board project registration.

The desktop offers multiple selection and one destination directory. It clones
each selected project into its named subdirectory and registers successful clones.
It can instead link an existing repository after checking its root and origin.
Repositories already registered with the same origin do not appear as available;
a stale installation action reuses their path. Retries preserve completed
projects; conflicting folders remain untouched.

Cloning uses Git installed on the Mac and local authentication. HTTPS and SSH are
the only accepted transports; credentials, local paths and executable transport
helpers cannot enter the document. Git hooks are disabled during clone. Prometeu
does not execute setup, install dependencies or select tools during registration.

## Consequences

Cloud stores definitions, never source files or Git credentials. Local project
paths live in board state and catalog installation links. Losing a definition,
membership or account connection never removes registered projects or files.

Older documents decode with an empty projects collection. Older desktop PUTs
that omit projects preserve stored definitions; an explicit empty collection
removes them. Publish Cloud support before the new desktop. Rolling back the
desktop preserves definitions; rolling back Cloud code requires a version that
still accepts stored projects. No schema migration is needed.

Existing catalog synchronization serializes installation operations and local
project additions/removals, so registration cannot change between the origin
check and the catalog installation. Project commands wait on worker threads,
without holding the board lock. Large clones can delay catalog refresh and local
project edits, as plugin installations already delay catalog refresh. Board reads
and unrelated workspace edits stay available. No background job system or
automatic setup is introduced.

The [catalog contract](../contracts/cloud-catalog.md) specifies wire behavior.
[Rust tests](../../src-tauri/src/catalog/projects.rs) use a local Git upload-pack
fixture for cloning, retry, existing-folder registration and file preservation.
[Browser tests](../../e2e/projects.spec.ts) cover selection, partial failure and
retry in Chromium, plus a representative layout and focus check in WebKit.
